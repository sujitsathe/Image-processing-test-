## Image Comparison Dashboard

This MATLAB-based project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to compare a selected test image with a dataset of training images. It uses feature extraction techniques to identify the best-matching training image and displays both the test image and the matched training image side by side.

## Features
- Load a dataset of training images.
- Select a single test image for comparison.
- Automatically process images to extract features using edge detection.
- Display the matched training image along with the test image.
- User-friendly dashboard built using MATLAB App Designer.

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2018b or later (with App Designer support).
- Image Processing Toolbox.
## Note
- You can add more images to dataset
- You need to download the image for browser and give name test_image
